This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

1. Core Features
These features are the foundation of any task management app.

a. Task Creation
Allow users to create tasks with details like title, description, due date, priority, and category.
Support rich text in descriptions (e.g., adding links, bold, italics).
b. Task List
Display tasks in a list, with filtering options (e.g., "All", "Completed", "Due Today", etc.).
Support pagination or infinite scrolling for large task lists.
c. Task Editing
Let users edit task details after creation (e.g., change title, due date, priority, etc.).
d. Task Completion
Allow users to mark tasks as "Complete" or "In Progress".
Provide options for users to unmark a task as complete or delete tasks.
e. Task Deletion
Option for users to delete tasks they no longer need.
2. Task Organization
These features help users stay organized and manage their tasks efficiently.

a. Task Categories
Allow users to categorize tasks (e.g., "Work", "Personal", "Shopping").
Provide color-coding or icons for quick identification.
b. Priority & Labels
Implement task prioritization (e.g., Low, Medium, High).
Allow users to tag tasks with labels for better organization (e.g., "Urgent", "Important").
c. Due Dates and Deadlines
Enable setting of task due dates and reminders.
Show tasks with deadlines in a calendar view or with a countdown.
d. Subtasks
Let users create subtasks for larger tasks.
Show subtasks with the option to mark them as completed individually.
e. Recurring Tasks
Allow users to set up recurring tasks (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
3. User Experience
Focus on making the app intuitive, engaging, and responsive.

a. Task Sorting and Filtering
Let users filter tasks by priority, due date, or status (completed vs. pending).
Allow sorting by different parameters (e.g., due date, creation date, priority).
b. Search Functionality
Implement a search bar to allow users to search for tasks by title, description, or label.
c. Dark Mode / Light Mode
Provide a dark mode for better usability in low-light environments.
d. Drag and Drop
Implement drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks or move tasks between lists or categories.
4. Collaboration Features (if your app targets teams or multiple users)
For collaborative task management, you might want to include features that allow multiple users to interact with the same tasks.

a. Team Management
Allow users to create or join teams or groups.
Support assigning tasks to specific team members.
b. Task Sharing
Let users share tasks with other people (via links or team collaboration).
Provide permissions (e.g., view-only, edit, etc.).
c. Comments and Discussions
Allow users to add comments or notes to tasks for collaboration.
Notify users when there are new comments or updates on tasks.
d. Activity Logs
Implement an activity feed or log to track changes in tasks (e.g., status changes, new comments, task assignments).
5. Notifications
Notifications help users stay on top of their tasks.

a. Push Notifications
Send push notifications for upcoming deadlines, task completion, or reminders.
b. Email or In-App Notifications
Notify users when a task is due, when someone assigns them a task, or when there are comments on tasks they are following.
c. Reminders
Allow users to set custom reminders for tasks (e.g., reminder 1 hour before the due date).
6. Data Sync and Storage
These features are important for ensuring that user data is safely stored and accessible across devices.

a. Cloud Syncing
Implement synchronization with a cloud storage service so tasks can be accessed across different devices.
b. Offline Mode
Provide an offline mode so users can add or view tasks when there’s no internet connection.
Sync data with the cloud once the user is back online.
c. Backup & Restore
Allow users to back up and restore their tasks to prevent data loss.
7. Advanced Features
You can implement these to further enhance the app’s functionality and user experience.

a. Time Tracking
Let users track time spent on each task, either manually or automatically.
b. Gantt Chart / Timeline View
Implement a Gantt chart or timeline view to visualize task deadlines, dependencies, and progress.
c. Voice Input
Allow users to add tasks via voice commands (e.g., "Add a task to buy groceries tomorrow").
d. Integration with Other Services
Integrate your app with other productivity tools (e.g., Google Calendar, Trello, Slack, or email) for better workflow integration.
e. Analytics & Reports
Generate reports on task completion, productivity trends, or team performance over time.
8. Security and Privacy
Make sure your app protects user data and offers secure usage.

a. User Authentication
Provide secure login options (e.g., OAuth with Google, Facebook, or email/password).
b. Data Encryption
Ensure sensitive data (e.g., task details, user info) is encrypted both in transit and at rest.
c. Role-based Access Control (for Teams)
For team functionality, provide role-based permissions (e.g., Admin, Manager, Member) for controlling access to features.
9. Mobile-Friendly Design
If you're building a mobile app (using Ionic, for example), focus on making it responsive and optimized for mobile devices.

a. Responsive Layouts
Use responsive design principles to ensure the app works seamlessly on both mobile and tablet devices.
b. Touch Gestures
Implement common mobile gestures like swipe to delete or mark a task as completed.
Tech Stack Recommendations:
Frontend: Vue 3 (or React if preferred), Ionic (for mobile app), TailwindCSS (for styling)
Backend: Node.js with Express or Firebase (for real-time functionality and authentication)
Database: Firebase Firestore (NoSQL), PostgreSQL, or MongoDB (depending on needs)
Authentication: Firebase Auth, Auth0, or custom OAuth with JWT
Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications
Development Tips:
Start Simple: Focus on building the core functionality first (task creation, editing, and completion).
Iterate Based on Feedback: If possible, share early versions with real users to get feedback and iterate.
Modularize: Break your app into smaller components and use a component-based architecture for reusability and easier maintenance.
By implementing a combination of these features, you'll end up with a highly functional and user-friendly task management app.
